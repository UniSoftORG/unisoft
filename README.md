## Main Description

This project aims to provide a dynamic, flexible, and extensible way to build React components through a strategy-based rendering system. 
Rather than creating each React component manually, developers can leverage various helper functions and features to generate components dynamically. 
This reduces boilerplate code and improves maintainability, especially for large-scale applications.
